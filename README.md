_Author_: Kyle Chinick

## Summary

Quiz application that determines the user's ideal programming language based on user-submitted form data.

## Technologies

## Description

This application provides users with a quiz that, upon submission, reviews quiz data to determine which programming language the user should learn first.

The project is intended for demonstration purposes and uses irrelevant, silly questions to determine which language should be learned. Please do not take your results as a professional recommendation.

### Current Recommendation Paths

As previously stated, this project is a demonstration only. Therefore it currently evaluates which language to recommend solely based on the user's response to the following question:
